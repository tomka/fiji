A loose TODO list for Fiji
==========================

- freeline selection with thickness has a display bug
- fix z-project, split channels for virtual stacks
- fix substack maker for hyperstacks
- provide preview for auto threshold plugin
- provide a plugin that runs another plugin with a range of parameters
- add an installer (translate the original WinGit installer to Java, using the
  progress infrastructure of the Fiji Updater; maybe need to use reflection
  to access java.util.prefs.WindowsPreferences)
- win: verify that console window stays open when falling back to system Java
- TrakEM2: use CommandListener to override the "File>Save" menu item
- move Amira I/O into bio-formats already
- headless: should we activate "batch"?
- find a way to set cwd for sed.py in VIB
- exclude ij.jar, headless.jar and precompiled/ij.jar from netbeans project
  (otherwise Netbeans will not use the ImageJ it compiled itself)
- netbeans: exclude the classes found in src-plugins/ij/**/*.java from ImageJA/
- test Bilateral Filter
- Segmentation Editor fails
- compile and test Java7 (has nasty bugs)
- Building "jars/fake.jar" on Windows should warn and resort to making
  precompiled/fake.jar directly.  Same goes for the Fiji launcher.
- add script recorder for the new scripting languages
- check which Reader Plugins do not extend ImagePlus
- extend GenericDialog to provide Help, Advanced, File button
- GenericDialog.addToolText()
- add tests (test that all plugins are found, test which image types
  they support, add regression tests, if file importers return ImagePlus)
- in ImageJA: add isCanceled() method to SaveDialog (is getDirectory() == null).
- in ImageJA: what about a file extension based construct similar to
  HandleExtraFileTypes for save?  This would allow to work on top of custom
  file formats seamlessly.
- make OpenDialog and SaveDialog more versatile by adding a KeyListener to
  both list boxes (but verify that this does not break on Windows and MacOSX).
- reimplement TransformJ (Stephan Preibisch)
- look at ITK
