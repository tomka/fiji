fiji (20100320) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update to upstream 59f7d1652296901b1616.  This is a first
    attempt at improved packaging.

fiji (20091116) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update to upstream 9c9fdc0d30473b5.  This version of the
    package has more dependencies and so the package is smaller.
    The package now depends on openjdk-6-jdk instead of
    sun-java6-jdk, but you can change this in either
    /etc/default/fiji or by setting JAVA_HOME.  This version
    also includes a change in the launcher so that other
    packages that need to depend on Fiji but need JNI libraries
    can be added more easily.

fiji (20091003) unstable; urgency=low

fiji (20090419) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update to upstream d98757aff58e2 for the Dresden-2009-rc1
    release.

fiji (20090216) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update to upstream f35261a1d6bc9cbe7dd7070.  This upstream
    version has the same submodule versions as the
    Fiji-Luxembourg release, but is from after the switch to the
    new repository.

fiji (20081030.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change the version numbering scheme again, hopefully for
    the last time.  Update to upstream 034213dae8a8e688a474ad

fiji (0.9.4.20081024rc5) unstable; urgency=low

  * A change back to a single package for Ubuntu and Debian
    which doesn't try to install the Java3D classes into
    /usr/lib/jvm/...

 -- Mark Longair <mhl@pobox.com>  Fri, 24 Oct 2008 23:00:00 +0200

fiji (0.9.3.20081015rc4) unstable; urgency=low

  * An update for the public release of Fiji to the ImageJ
    mailing list.  The key difference here is that we no
    longer include the JVM, but instead depend on
    sun-java6-bin (with different versions for Ubuntu and
    Debian.)

fiji (0.9.3.20080807rc3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fiji should now appear in the GNOME and KDE menus under
    the "Graphics" subsection.  Also fixed the launcher
    script and location of the binary.

 -- Mark Longair <mhl@pobox.com>  Fri, 11 Aug 2008 15:57:00 +0200

fiji (0.9.2.20080807rc3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changing the version number scheme to be more sane

 -- Mark Longair <mhl@pobox.com>  Fri, 08 Aug 2008 22:21:00 +0200

fiji (0.9.1-Dresden-rc3) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is a package of the Dresden-rc3 release.  In this version
    I have abandoned the careful approach of the previous packages
    and this is just a monolithic package with everything you
    need for Fiji.  This is more in the spirit of the Fiji project,
    but would create a lot of problems if it were to be included
    in Debian / Ubuntu in the future.  For the moment it's more
    important that we can just get a .deb out there for the release.

fiji (0.9.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

fiji (0.9.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial packaging, from version-0.9.0
