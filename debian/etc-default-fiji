# You can set the FIJI_JAVA_HOME environment variable to use a Java virtual
# machine other than the default, that in openjdk-6-jdk.  For example,
# to switch to the Sun Java 6 JDK, you could uncomment this line:
#
#FIJI_JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/
#
# Note that if the user has set JAVA_HOME in their environment, then that
# setting will override both FIJI_JAVA_HOME and the default.
